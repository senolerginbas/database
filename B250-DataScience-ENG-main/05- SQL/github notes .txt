// Benefit of branching system 

//important
when you make a change on one branch and commit then you wont see that change 
in other branches, because each and every single branch work seperatedly, 
thats how you protect the main branch from possible issues 
every developer will be responsible for their own branches 
the development will be faster in this way 
less error will be occured 
and the problems can be fixed easily 
the codes will be more organized 
this is how our codes be safe
